Here is a transcript of the Zen of Python itself, as you would have by running `python -m this` or `import this` within a Python shell:

```txt
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

## If you're interested in a printed version, you can:

 - Buy one on [DeviantArt](http://ewjoachim.deviantart.com/art/Zen-of-Python-Poster-397139195). I get around 15% of the price and so far, I've been sending this money (which for 2 years of this poster beeing sold was $10 !) to the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/)
 - Have it printed by a professionnal nearby on glossy paper for $20 to $80 depending on the size (of the poster) and the greediness (of your nearby print company). (I got mine for ~$40 but the quality is really neat)
 - Display it on a giant TV or using a projector, but that's not cool for both penguins and your elecricity bill.

## This poster of the Zen of Python uses material borrowed from different source:

 - [The Zen of Python by Tim Peters](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), included in every good distribution of Python if you type ``import this``
 - It mainly uses the [Menlo font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_(typeface)) which is used by [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) on OSX
 - It uses the [Monokai Classic](https://github.com/rjfranco/monokai-light/blob/a96af9ead72f3761198bfb82fc56a7f52e7930c0/Monokai.tmTheme) and [Monokai Light](https://github.com/anoff/hyper-monokai-light/blob/9b0bd528805e5561395bab4e0c7935d3e8756b5b/index.js) color schemes
 - There are also traces of other fonts which I'm sure you can recognize (and probably nuts)

## The poster is distributed as different formats:

 - png (Web and "Print". There's no such thing as a png for print but you'll get less ugly pixels from the hi-res version)
 - pdf
 - svg
 - InDesign

## What this poster will bring to your everyday work:

 - The safety of knowing that you can now easily refer to any of the Zen of Python lines by its number
 - A geek decoration to your desk surroundings that will warn people that they're about to hear some high quality philosophical pythonic advice
 - Inspiration and guid(o)ance when struggling on an important design decision
